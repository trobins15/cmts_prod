              <br><br>At the CMTS Coordinating Board meeting held July 21, 2021, the Board approved a CMTS proclamation on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). This document sets a foundation for interagency engagement related to DEI within the CMTS member maritime agencies and in support of DEI within the marine transportation system. The Coordinating Board further approved the establishment of a "DEI Task Team" led by the CMTS Executive Secretariat which has begun developing a workplan to implement the directive which includes engagement with the Ship Operations Cooperative Program at their annual fall event in September 2021.

          The Arctic IAT has developed an inventory of Federally-owned and operated communications systems at use in the U.S. Arctic. The inventory includes components from four different agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard, NOAA, FAA, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This effort was completed in response to a request by Alaskan Native Communities interested in Federal communications capabilities in the U.S. Arctic. The inventory, along with a response letter, was transmitted to the Alaskan Native Communities in July 2020.

            The U.S. Committee on the Marine Transportation System (CMTS) established the COVID-19 Working Group to facilitate interagency coordination in response to shared challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. CMTS Coordinating Board Chair RDML Richard Timme and Maritime Administrator retired RADM Mark Buzby led the formation of the Working Group in recognition of the importance of supporting the efficient operation of the Marine Transportation System (MTS) under COVID-19. The Working Group provides a forum not only for the sharing of best practices between federal agencies, but also to engage with stakeholders and to learn from industry experiences on the front lines of the pandemic.

           Over 50 Federal agencies joined a webinar on August 25, 2020 hosted by The U.S. Committee on the Marine Transportation System (CMTS), "Understanding Tribal Engagement in the U.S. Arctic." Mr. Rob Edwardson, Tribal Liaison for the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), District -17 (D-17) shared his lifetime of experience as a Native Alaskan (and retired USCG!) on the extent of USCG jurisdiction in Alaska and working with a Native population who have lived in the region for 10,000 years. Alaska is home to 229 Tribes of the 573 Tribes in the U.S. Alaskan Tribal history, organizations, and land management is very different than for Tribes in the "lower 48," requiring a sensitivity to the complicated state laws, jurisdictions, and traditions before starting even informal engagement. Mr. Richardson also shared the challenges for USCG in a D-17 area of responsibility that covers 3.9 million square miles; a jurisdiction that goes well out into the Pacific, into the Arctic; and borders Canada and Russia. For more information about USCG D-17 Tribal relations, contact Robert.H.Richardson@uscg.mil. For more information about CMTS work with Arctic maritime shipping, contact Geoffrey.Dipre@cmts.gov.

              <br><br> We are pleased to announce that the CMTS compendium of Marine Transportation System-Related Federal Advisory Committees (FAC) has been updated from the July 2019 version.
              <br>
              The list includes 35 committees, of which 2 are maritime committees not subject to FACA rules. FACs were established in 1971 under Public Law 92-463, to ensure that recommendations provided by the various advisory committees is objective and accessible to the public. A FAC is a committee, board, or council, subject to rules related to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) that can advise or give recommendations to a sponsoring Federal agency or department. Fifty-one percent of FACs from the 2019 edition were updated, with 2 committees added to the matrix: the Committee and the National Geospatial Advisory Committee, and the National Maritime Interagency Advisory Group (NIAG).
              <br>
              The CMTS updates the MTS-related Federal Advisory Committee list to engage the agency Designated Federal Officers (DFO) and provide an appropriate forum to share priority MTS issue and opportunity for coordination among committees, as appropriate.
