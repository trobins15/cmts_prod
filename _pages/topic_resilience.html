				<h1>RESILIENCE INTEGRATED ACTION TEAM</h1>
				<blockquote>"The Nation's critical infrastructure provides the essential services that underpin American society. Proactive and coordinated efforts are necessary to strengthen and maintain secure, functioning, and resilient critical infrastructure—including assets, networks, and systems—that are vital to public confidence and the Nation's safety, prosperity, and well-being."
					<small>from Presidential Policy Directive 21: Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience</small>

					<section>
						<h2>Purpose</h2>
						<p>The MTS Resilience IAT (R-IAT) was established to focus on cross-Federal agency knowledge co-production and governance in order to incorporate the concepts of resilience into the operation and management of the U.S. Marine Transportation System. For the purposes of this team, resilience is defined as the ability to prepare and plan for, resist, recover from, and more successfully adapt to the impacts of adverse events.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Value</h2>
						<p>The R-IAT seeks to affect future resilience policy and aid in delivering enhanced resilience programs through identifying, coordinating, and leveraging complementary Federal investments and activities related to MTS resilience.</p>
