               In support of the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for sustainable Development, the U.S. Committee on the Marine Transportation System (CMTS) is partnering with the Embassy of Denmark and Norwegian Embassy to co-host a virtual public forum for meaningful discussion on applied science and technologies toward a sustainable marine transportation system (MTS) for healthier oceans. The webinar will be held virtually via WebEx on Tuesday, December 14 from 0900 – 1100 U.S. Eastern Time. Opening remarks will be provided by Ms. Lucinda Lessley, Acting Administrator of the U.S. Maritime Administration, with an overview on Decade of the Ocean provided by Mr. Julian Barbiére, Head of Marine Policy and Regional Coordination Section, Ocean Decade Focal Point, UNESCO - IOC.
               <br><br>
               The event will also feature a panel of international representatives engaged in applied science and technologies fostering a more sustainable MTS to include Dr. Arne Fredheim, Research Director with the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Mr. Claus Winter Graugaard, Head of Onboard Vessel Solutions with the Maersk McKinney Moller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping, and Dr. Joe Pratt, CEO and CTO of Zero Emission Industries. Ms. Helen Brohl, Executive Director of the CMTS will moderate the event. We invite you to join us as we envision sustainable development of the MTS for healthier oceans.

          Infrastructure Week 2019
          For the past four years, the CMTS has been participating in national Infrastructure Week to bring attention to the significance of marine transportation system infrastructure within national infrastructure discussions. Infrastructure Week (May 13-20, 2019) is a collaborative effort by businesses, civic groups, organizations, and other infrastructure stakeholders to bring awareness to the importance of infrastructure in our nation. Through events, advocacy, webinars, and social media taking place around the country, participants will bring attention to infrastructure. Infrastructure Week is the largest, most diverse, non-partisan coalition of organizations dedicated to strengthening America by rebuilding our infrastructure.</div>

                  In June 2018, President Trump released Executive Order 13840, which outlined the Administration’s ocean policy to advance the economic, security, and environmental interests of the United States. The Executive Order specifically calls for federal agencies to facilitate the economic growth of coastal communities and promote ocean industries. While not specifically mentioned in the Executive Order, the marine transportation system underpins vital components of ocean industries, including aspects of the Blue Economy.

                  <br>
                  Investing in port infrastructure and operations is vital to America's business competitiveness and economic prosperity. This webinar will explore the tools and methods available for developing baseline emission inventories and reduction strategies that ports could explore to support environmental goals and prioritize future investment. Presenters will provide an overview of the EPA Ports Initiative, which support efforts to improve efficiency, enhance energy security, save costs, and reduce harmful health impacts by advancing next-generation, clean technologies and practices at ports. The Ports Initiative also facilitates collaboration between the port industry, communities, and all levels of government to help ensure timely and effective infrastructure developments. To demonstrate the importance of collaboration with non-federal partners at ports, our presenters will also review some of the key findings from the EPA's recent partnership with Port Everglades, which aimed to better understand mobile source emissions at ports.

                    Please join the U.S. Committee on the Marine Transportation System (CMTS) and its Marine Transportation System (MTS) Federal partners as they share their vision on maritime infrastructure. Infrastructure in this context addresses not only physical infrastructure, but also informational infrastructure (such as aids to navigation, nautical charts, and real-time meteorological and oceanographic services) and mariner needs.
                    <br>
                    This seminar provides the opportunity to connect with maritime agencies including U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Maritime Administration, Department of Homeland Security Infrastructure Protection, and others on their status and priorities for maritime infrastructure.

                  Speaker Series on Maritime Port Resilience: Lessons from the 2017 Hurricane Season   
                  <br><br>
                The 2017 hurricane season was a time of significant disruption to the Marine Transportation System (MTS), resulting in significant economic, social, and logistical challenges. As we examine the MTS response and recovery to these events, we are provided with the opportunity to garner recommendations for more resilient MTS infrastructure through the consideration of interagency cooperation and best practices.
                <br><br>
                Please join the U.S. Committee on the Marine Transportation System (CMTS) during National Infrastructure Week 2018 for a discussion on port infrastructure resilience and lessons learned from the dramatic 2017 hurricane season. This discussion provides the opportunity to learn from Federal MTS agencies and stakeholders, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Department of Homeland Security Office of Infrastructure Protection, and the American Association of Port Authorities.
                <br><br>
                Date: Friday, May 18, 2018, 10:00 AM – 11:30 AM EST

                           Infrastructure Week (May 16-23, 2016) is a collaborative effort by businesses, civic groups, organizations, and other infrastructure stakeholders to bring awareness to the importance of infrastructure in our nation. Through events, advocacy, webinars, and social media taking place around the country, participants will bring attention to infrastructure. Infrastructure Week is the largest, most diverse, non-partisan coalition of organizations dedicated to strengthening America by rebuilding our infrastructure. See how you can be involved at http://infrastructureweek.org.

Follow us on our social media sites (Facebook and Twitter) to bring awareness to MTS infrastructure. You, too, can engage in the conversation using the Infrastructure Week hashtag #InfrastructureMatters.
