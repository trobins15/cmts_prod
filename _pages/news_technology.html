              On October 6th 2020 the U.S. Committee on the Marine Transportation System’s (CMTS) Resilience Integrated Action Team (RIAT) presented a Transportation Research Board (TRB) webinar titled A Resilient Path Forward for the Marine Transportation System (https://webinar.mytrb.org/Webinars/Details/1425).
              <br><br>
              The objectives of the webinar were to discuss broad challenges, practices, and successes of hurricane resilience; identify whether challenges have been addressed between hurricane seasons; and determine how to use data and communication to become more resilient. The presentation discussed the response and recovery efforts that were done to better prepare between the 2017-2019 hurricane seasons and identify and prioritize recommendations to minimize the impact from future storms and other disruptive events. The webinar had 85 attendees from diverse backgrounds including universities, various State Department of Transportation Offices, MARAD, USACE, BSEE, NOAA, USCG, EPA, and FHWA. The presentation was well received, and the audience asked thought provoking questions during the Q&A session. Thank you to the RIAT co-leads and team for all their work and dedication and thank you to TRB for organizing and hosting the webinar.
