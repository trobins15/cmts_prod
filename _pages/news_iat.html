          The CMTS Arctic Marine Transportation Integrated Action Team (Arctic IAT) issued the report, The 2021 U.S. Arctic Infrastructure Table Update (April 2021), an updated inventory of vital marine transportation system (MTS) components in the U.S. Arctic. This 2021 report includes over 40 substantial updates, changes, and additions to the original 2013 infrastructure table. As maritime activity in the US Arctic evolves and grows, it is necessary to understand the current state of infrastructure supporting the MTS. The CMTS was directed in the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010 to coordinate transportation policy in the US Arctic for safety and security and established the US Arctic Maritime Transportation Integrated Action Team. This table was originally introduced in the CMTS 2013 report, 
          <a href="../../assets/uploads/documents/CMTS_US_Arctic_MTS_Report_07-30-13.pdf">U.S. Arctic Marine Transportation System: Overview and Priorities for Action</a>, and was updated as an appendix in 
          <a href="../../assets/uploads/documents/NearTermRecommendationsArctic2018.pdf">2018</a>.
          <br><br>
          "The 2021 Arctic MTS infrastructure table serves as a valuable repository of current Arctic marine transportation system infrastructure for federal agencies, Tribal representatives, and stakeholders to use as shipping steadily increases in a strategic region that has never been more relevant," noted Rear Admiral Richard Timme, Assistant Commandant for Prevention Policy, U.S. Coast Guard and CMTS Coordinating Board Chair.
          <br><br>
          The CMTS was directed in the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010 to coordinate transportation policy in the US Arctic for safety and security. The interagency Arctic IAT was subsequently formed and has since published a number of seminal documents including the 
          A Ten Year Projection of Maritime Activity in the U.S. Arctic (2015, 2019), 
          <a href="../../assets/uploads/documents/NearTermRecommendationsArctic2018.pdf">A Ten Year Prioritization of Infrastructure Needs in the U.S. Arctic (2016)</a>,

                  Performance measures, indicators, or metrics help to demonstrate how elements are functioning within a larger complex system, such as an international supply chain. Performance measurement is a process to evaluate the relationship between inputs and outputs within the structure of a specific system and, subsequently, to identify areas of possible improvement. Ultimately, regular performance measurement can assist with decision support by providing consistent and quantitative feedback relevant to long-term performance goals.
                  <br><br>
                  This report identifies important gaps in our current knowledge of U.S. marine transportation system performance and describes a roadmap for using current and future performance data in research on nationally significant intermodal freight flows. The report drew on expert input from multiple Federal agencies and offices, including the Department of Transportationâ€"Bureau of Transportation Statistics, the Maritime Administration, the U.S. Committee on the Marine Transportation System, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  A <a href="http://navigation.usace.army.mil/MTS/Performance">companion public website</a> features graphical summaries of the current list of MTS performance measures.

                  Producer PriceIntermodal freight moves from one mode to another, such as water-to-truck or truck-to-rail. As supply chains get longer and more complex, it is possible that the amount of intermodal traffic will increase. This figure shows monthly intermodal freight totals in North America, as reported by the transportation industry, from 2010 to 2014. Although these are normal month-to-month variations, the overall trend is more intermodal freight with every passing year.              </div>

                    Dr. Rosati gave a very detailed, yet comprehensible, briefing on standard resiliency definitions and the resilience assessments she and her team have created for inland and coastal systems. These models range from rapid, screening-level assessments to rigorous, design-quality assessments. These methods were developed and evaluated as part of a project for Jamaica Bay, NY: a study of community resilience to storm damage. She demonstrated that these models are generally applicable to any watershed system with functional objectives and recovery goals. Many thanks to Dr. Rosati for taking the time to speak!
                    <br><br>
                    Dr. Julie Rosati is a research coastal engineer with the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Engineer Research and Development Center's (ERDC's) Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory (CHL). She is an ERDC leader in coastal navigation research and has been the lead scientist on incorporating resilience into USACE practice through engaging other agencies and academia in an interagency, interdisciplinary team approach.
                    <br><br>
