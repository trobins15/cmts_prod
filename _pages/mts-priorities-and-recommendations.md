## MTS PRIORITIES AND CMTS RECOMMENDATIONS
</span>

#### OPTIMIZE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE

1. Provide interagency expertise in support of the development of a high fidelity freight flow model.

    Measurement: Develop a research statement for a high-fidelity multimodal freight flow model.
    
    Measurement: Coordinate and apply Big Data analytics to reveal research gaps and overlap, foster potential collaboration, manage knowledge, and inform decision-making.

2. Increase data access, linkages and integration of authoritative data from agencies and organizations with mission areas related to maritime data and the broader intermodal freight flow network.

    Measurement: Create specific MTS system-scale performance indicators that relate to the freight flow network so they may be periodically updated and used for network calibration and validation.
    
    Measurement: Couple the newly-available vehicle probe data sets with more traditional freight data resources to quantify and contextualize travel times, dwell times, trip counts and other metrics.
3. Provide interagency MTS expertise in support of the reduction of system congestion and supply chain bottlenecks.

    Measurement: Engage and support Federal partners, as appropriate, including DOT’s reporting requirements under the FAST Act and existing foundational work performed by CMTS member agencies.

#### ENHANCE NAVIGATION SAFETY
4. Develop and maintain a CMTS-member agency list of most-wanted improvements to enhance or sustain safety of the MTS including U.S. Arctic navigation.

    Measurement: Once the list is established, monitor reduction in the number of safety-related concerns from the most-wanted list.
    
    Measurement: Provide updates on the recommended actions in the CMTS report, "Priorities of Investments to MTS Infrastructure in the U.S. Arctic."

5. Deliver timely, relevant, accurate and user-accessible navigation safety information to mariners.

    Measurement: Reduce the latency of navigation safety information.

    Measurement: Examine NTSB, USCG and other sources of accident investigation information for root and contributing causes related to navigation information.
    
6. Incorporate MTS resilience and recovery capabilities into waterway design principles to best identify appropriate levels of service relating to delivery of navigation safety services.

    Measurement: Decrease the number of vessel delays related to loss of navigation services that are not due to natural causes such as high or low water.

    Measurement: Coordinate waterway-based resilience risk analyses and models with land-based initiatives across the Federal government.

7. Support the presentation of best available weather information in support of MTS operations.

    Measurement: Form a weather task force to analyze the weather information dissemination and develop best practices for various weather conditions, particularly from extreme weather situations common in the MTS environment.
    Measurement: Support NOAA’s requirement of Increased number of ship-provided weather observations available for use in extreme weather forecasting.

#### SUPPORT MARITIME SECURITY
8. Develop CMTS-member agency list of most wanted MTS security improvements.

    Measurement: Produce a catalog of Federal maritime security programs that support interagency assessments and engagements in maritime security initiatives.
    
    Measurement: Determine interagency priorities through CMTS member engagement and coordination with National Security Counsel's maritime security working group.
    
9. Develop policies, as needed, intended to advance security-related information sharing while acknowledging and supporting cyber security requirements.

    Measurement: Provide support to the interagency related to coordination for implementation of The National Strategy for Maritime Security.
    
    Measurement: Support interagency initiatives that advocate the sharing of maritime related data related to cyber security.

#### ADVANCE ENERGY INNOVATION AND DEVELOPMENT
10. Promote interagency collaboration encouraging the development of alternative fuels for propulsion purposes.

    Measurement: Establish an interagency working group to support interagency collaboration in the development of alternative fuels.
   Measurement: Report the development, types, availability, and use of alternative fuels.

11. Develop a priority list of MTS-related strategies to support domestic energy innovation and development; identify technologies and innovations that lead to more efficient and cheaper energy use (e.g. alternative fuels, shore power applications, conversion to all-electric cranes, vessel pilot projects).

    Measurement: Adoption rate of strategies on the priority list by MTS users, including Federal agencies and private operators.
    
    Measurement: Encourage the vessel operators to use maritime information to reduce the need for lightering, risk of oils spills, and more efficient fuel use.

### FACILITATE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT

12. Develop and use decision support tools to identify nationally significant priority areas and project locations where Agencies can leverage a variety of funding opportunities.

    Measurement: Percentage of MTS infrastructure projects vetted against the decision support tool.
    Measurement: Number of instances of aligned projects recommended for funding and implementation.

13. Facilitate innovative private sector financing mechanisms to augment Federal funds, including the use of Public-Private Partnerships (P3's) and other alternative financing tools.

    Measurement: Number of projects using existing alternative financing to leverage Federal MTS investments.
    Measurement: Percent increased use of new alternative financing mechanisms.

14. Encourage career opportunities in MTS fields; particularly transitioning Military and Veterans’ communities.

    Measurement: Increased number of military training courses to meet Merchant Mariner credential requirements.
    Measurement: Enhanced outreach to encourage merchant mariner credentialing.
