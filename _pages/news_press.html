          The CMTS COVID-19 Working Group (C-19 WG) encourages mariners from all segments of the U.S. maritime industry to take ten minutes to anonymously complete the “Mariner Mental Health Needs during Covid-19” online survey at https://redcap.link/mariners.
          <br><br>
          The confidential survey asks mariners a variety of questions about COVID-19, mental health, and their experiences and feelings when aboard a vessel during the challenges of this worldwide pandemic. No mariner identification data will be collected. Survey participation from a significant portion of the mariners in each industry segment is critical to understanding how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected their mental health. The survey is available from January 22 through May 31, 2021.
          <br><br>
          Results from the survey will be shared with federal agencies, vessel owners/operators, mariner unions, maritime training institutions, seafarer welfare organizations and MTS stakeholders to facilitate development of effective solutions that benefit our mariners’ mental well-being.
          <br><br>
          Mariner unions, vessel operators, vessel owners, mariner training institutions and industry associations are requested to encourage and facilitate the prompt participation of their mariners in this survey. MTS stakeholders are requested to widely distribute this announcement within the U.S. maritime industry.
          <br><br>
          The survey is being conducted independently by Dr. Marissa Baker, Assistant Professor & Industrial Hygiene Program Director, University of Washington School of Public Health. Individual responses will be kept confidential at the School. The survey allows mariners to skip any question which they do not wish to answer.
          <br><br>
          This survey is supported by Centers for Disease Prevention & Control (CDC) and the COVID-19 Working Group (C-19 WG). The C-19 WG serves as the CMTS forum for facilitating high-level interagency discussion, communication, and actions in support of the MTS under and after COVID-19. The following resources were developed by the C-19 WG for mariners and the U.S. Marine Transportation System:

      <h3 class="title"> Now available: An Economic Analysis of Spending on Marine Transportation System (MTS) Infrastructure</h3>
      <div class="text-base margin-bottom-2">
        <div class="margin-top-neg-105">      
           <span style="font-size:small;">Posted On: April 04, 2020</span>
            <div>  
            </div>
            A new report, An Economic Analysis of Spending on Marine Transportation System (MTS) Infrastructure (April 2020) conducted by Inforum at the University of Maryland for the U.S. Committee on the Marine Transportation System (CMTS), demonstrates that increasing investment in marine transportation system (MTS) infrastructure above a business-as-usual scenario will improve U.S. economic performance. Specifically, we can expect additional MTS investment to deliver higher levels of GDP, more jobs, increased incomes, improved trade performance, and higher productivity.
            <br><br>
            “This report illustrates that our marine transportation system is an essential part of the Blue Economy and the Nation’s GDP, making a persuasive argument for how infrastructure investment could aid in economic growth,” said RDML Tim Gallaudet, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, Deputy Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and Chair of the CMTS Coordinating Board.
            <br><br>
            Compared to a baseline forecast that assumes continuation of limited public infrastructure investment that leads to reduced efficiencies and higher costs, the report finds the following:
            <br><br>
            In the short term, enhancing the level of infrastructure spending would boost jobs by between 54.7 thousand and 182.5 thousand jobs in 2025, depending on the scenario.
            By 2030, the level of real GDP would rise between about $8 billion and $41 billion in 2012 dollars.
            Because of cumulative effects through time, by 2045 infrastructure investments could produce economy-wide returns of between $2 and $3 per every $1 spent, after adjusting for inflation.
            The quantitative analysis underpinning the study uses data that spans a historical period ending in 2019, before the onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, while the basic conclusions of the study remain valid, the magnitude of the benefits of MTS investment will likely be smaller. For example, the report notes that, in the short term, additional investment will boost demand in the economy as construction workers spend their incomes on goods and services. Under current COVID-19 response practices, however, there will be fewer operating businesses where construction workers can spend their incomes, at least for a time. This means the short-term demand boost stemming from capital outlays will be smaller than estimated in the report.
            <br><br>
            It is important to note that the study finds most of the gains to GDP from 2020-2045 - 80 percent, in fact - will be due to higher productivity (output per hour worked), and the rest to increased employment. This should provide some comfort that under these changing economic times, even if employees only gradually return to work, the country should still expect to see noticeable gains in GDP.

            The U.S. Committee on the Marine Transportation System (CMTS) has completed its biennial update of the “Federal Funding Handbook for Marine Transportation System Infrastructure,” one of the most downloaded items on the CMTS website. This is the fourth iteration of the Handbook since it was first produced in 2013.
            <br><br>
            “The CMTS Federal Funding Handbook connects Federal resources to our stakeholders for investment in, and strengthening of, our marine transportation system infrastructure,” said RDML Tim Gallaudet, Deputy Director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Chair of the CMTS Coordinating Board.
            <br><br>
            The 4th edition of the CMTS Federal Funding Handbook contains 75 authorized funding, financing, and technical assistance programs for infrastructure in the marine transportation system. This document is a compilation of existing and recent Federal funding programs. New to this edition, the funding programs are now divided into seven distinct categories (in comparison to four categories in the 3rd edition). These categories are:
            <br><br>
            Infrastructure
            Economic Development<br>
            Energy<br>
            Resilience<br>
            Safety and Security<br>
            Environment and Sustainability<br>
            Research and Development<br>
            Of note, this edition includes the Port Infrastructure Development Program, which includes $292.7 million in new discretionary grant funding for coastal seaports.
            <br><br>
            The purpose of this Handbook is to serve as a value-added tool for local and non-federal level practitioners as well as Federal stakeholders. No program is endorsed nor are the programs listed all-inclusive. This is a living document that will be updated periodically. To that end, we welcome stakeholder input to ensure this handbook continues to be a valuable and relevant document. Please direct your feedback to the CMTS at MTSinfo@cmts.gov.

            </div>
            Last month, the CMTS and the U.S. Arctic Research Commission, with support from the Wilson Center's Polar Institute, hosted the technical workshop, "Arctic Shipping: Boom, Bust, or Baseline?" Over the course of this two-day workshop, 35 participants from the Federal family, academia, industry, other Arctic Nations, and Tribal interests discussed the future of vessel activity in U.S. Arctic waters. This workshop and the information gleaned from it are critical first steps to updating forecasts of vessel activity in U.S. Arctic waters, which the CMTS's Arctic Marine Transportation Integrated Action Team will complete in 2019.
            <br><br>
            Following an introduction by CMTS Executive Director, Helen Brohl, Dr. Lawson Brigham, Ph.D., Distinguished Professor of Geography and Arctic Policy at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and retired USCG Captain, and Dr. Alyson Azzara, Ph.D., International Trade Specialist within the U.S. Department of Transportation's Maritime Administration, provided an overview of two past efforts to understand the role of shipping in tomorrow's Arctic. The Arctic Council's 2009 Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment provided a detailed account of current and future marine activity across the entirety of the Arctic, with an eye to the challenges of marine safety and environmental protection in such an extreme and sensitive environment. In 2015, as part of the National Strategy for the Arctic Region Implementation Plan, the CMTS delivered The 10-Year Projection Study of Maritime Activity in the U.S. Arctic which projected vessel activity in the U.S. Arctic region of interest out until 2025.
            <br><br>
            Much has changed in the region, however, since the release of these two reports, and for the remainder of the workshop, participants provided their input on three key questions to guide the next projection report: (1) What drives (and will drive) vessel activity in the U.S. Arctic? (2) Which drivers are the most important to consider? and (3) How can those drivers be measured?
            <br><br>
            Workshop participants spent the afternoon of the first day discussing all the possible drivers of Arctic vessel activity, from the development of non-traditional natural resources to global commodity prices. In small break-out groups, participants discussed ways to ranking the listed drivers as a function of the probability to happen and the potential impact on marine vessel activity in U.S. Arctic waters. The qualitative discussions of the first day gave way to thorough quantitative discussions on the second day as participants shared resources and metrics to incorporate into the next iteration of projecting vessel activity in the U.S. Arctic.
            <br><br>
            The CMTS extends a warm thank you to all participants and to the U.S. Arctic Research Commission and the Wilson Center. If you would like to provide input on what you think drives Arctic vessel activity or to learn more about this effort, please contact MTSInfo@cmts.gov or call Sarah Harrison at 202-366-7053.</div>

            Following a welcome from Mr. Mike Sfraga of the Wilson Center, Mr. Deerin Babb-Brott from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy provided an overview of the recent <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-regarding-ocean-policy-advance-economic-security-environmental-interests-united-states/">Executive Order</a> outlining the new Ocean Policy to advance the economic, security, and environmental interests of the United States.
            <Br><bR>
            Our speakers, including RDML Shep Smith, RADM Jon White, RADM Dave Titley, Mr. Pål Somdalen, and Mr. Malte Søndergaard, each provided their unique perspective on where marine transportation fits into the wider discussion of ocean policy in a conversation moderated by CMTS Executive Director, Ms. Helen Brohl. They discussed a wide range of issues including the possibility of a deep-draft port in Nome, the changing environment in the Arctic, and how new technology and big data is revolutionizing marine transportation in unimaginable ways, among many other topics. Our speakers highlighted the need for not just a whole-of-government approach, but also a cooperative international approach to maximize efforts in ensuring sustainable use of the ocean while maintaining a healthy and growing marine transportation system. Ultimately, the conversations concluded that the maritime transportation system is incredibly vital to ocean policy.
            <Br><bR>
            Since our inception 13 years ago, the CMTS has worked to improve coordination across agencies responsible for the United States marine transportation system, and we believe that we have enabled our Federal partners to work towards that mission.

                  The CMTS Industry Outreach Workshop was held on Monday, June 11 at the U.S. Department of Transportation and was attended by nearly 70 marine transportation system (MTS) stakeholders and partners. Eleven Federal partners shared their vision of maritime infrastructure from Administration priorities to ongoing Agency actions. Our partners addressed how informational infrastructure is increasing the safety and efficiency of the MTS, Federal efforts to increase data sharing, the need for mariners to support our MTS, new developments in the Federal fleet, and Arctic infrastructure needs, among other topics. The conversations emphasized the diversity of the Agency roles within the MTS and the importance of interagency coordination in this arena.
                  <br>
                  On May 19, 2017, the CMTS and the Water Infrastructure Working Group hosted an engaging interagency discussion on the state of water-related infrastructure. Representatives from the U.S. Department of Transportation, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency participated.

                  The CMTS has issued the summary report of the biennial Marine Transportation System (MTS) research conference, 
                  <a href="../../assets/uploads/documents/Innovative_Technologies_for_a_Resilient_Marine_Transportation_System.pdf">Innovative Technologies for a Resilient Marine Transportation System</a>, held with the Transportation Research Board on June 24-26, 2014.
              <br><br>
                  The purpose of the conference was to work toward a more resilient MTS through the identification of current innovative technologies, gaps in knowledge, or future technology needs; to determine current and future disturbances to the MTS; and to uncover opportunities for collaboration. This report is a research and development call to action to help guide near-term MTS research by assimilating broad ideas that were presented during the conference keynote and plenary panels and introducing the innovative emerging technologies that are being developed by academia, the federal government, and private industry.
