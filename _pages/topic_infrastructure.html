				<h1>INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT INTEGRATED ACTION TEAM</h1>
			    <blockquote>"Billions of tons of product valued in the trillions of dollars move through our ports annually, so even small improvements in our ports efficiencies have tremendous economic impact."

						<h2>Purpose</h2>
						<p>The Infrastructure Investment Integrated Action Team (IAT) facilitates the development of broad evaluation and decision criteria that are used to inform a whole-of-government approach to Federal infrastructure investment. The team focuses on developing tools that are value-added for practitioners at all levels of government, including Federal, State, local and tribal.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Value</h2>
						<p>Decision tools for infrastructure investment will be used by decision-makers to better align Federal infrastructure investment across agencies, enabling a safer, more efficient, and resilient marine transportation system for the movement of our Nation's people and goods.</p>
