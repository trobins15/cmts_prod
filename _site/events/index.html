          Infrastructure Week 2019
          For the past four years, the CMTS has been participating in national Infrastructure Week to bring attention to the significance of marine transportation system infrastructure within national infrastructure discussions. Infrastructure Week (May 13-20, 2019) is a collaborative effort by businesses, civic groups, organizations, and other infrastructure stakeholders to bring awareness to the importance of infrastructure in our nation. Through events, advocacy, webinars, and social media taking place around the country, participants will bring attention to infrastructure. Infrastructure Week is the largest, most diverse, non-partisan coalition of organizations dedicated to strengthening America by rebuilding our infrastructure.</div>

                  In June 2018, President Trump released Executive Order 13840, which outlined the Administration’s ocean policy to advance the economic, security, and environmental interests of the United States. The Executive Order specifically calls for federal agencies to facilitate the economic growth of coastal communities and promote ocean industries. While not specifically mentioned in the Executive Order, the marine transportation system underpins vital components of ocean industries, including aspects of the Blue Economy.

                  Following an introduction by Mr. Deerin Babb-Brott, Principle Assistant Director of Oceans and Environment, Office of Science and Technology Policy, panelists will discuss their diverse perspectives on ocean policy and marine transportation in a conversation moderated by Ms. Helen Brohl, Executive Director of the U.S. Committee on the Marine Transportation System.

                  <br>
                  Investing in port infrastructure and operations is vital to America's business competitiveness and economic prosperity. This webinar will explore the tools and methods available for developing baseline emission inventories and reduction strategies that ports could explore to support environmental goals and prioritize future investment. Presenters will provide an overview of the EPA Ports Initiative, which support efforts to improve efficiency, enhance energy security, save costs, and reduce harmful health impacts by advancing next-generation, clean technologies and practices at ports. The Ports Initiative also facilitates collaboration between the port industry, communities, and all levels of government to help ensure timely and effective infrastructure developments. To demonstrate the importance of collaboration with non-federal partners at ports, our presenters will also review some of the key findings from the EPA's recent partnership with Port Everglades, which aimed to better understand mobile source emissions at ports.

                  Speaker Series on Maritime Port Resilience: Lessons from the 2017 Hurricane Season   
                  <br><br>
                The 2017 hurricane season was a time of significant disruption to the Marine Transportation System (MTS), resulting in significant economic, social, and logistical challenges. As we examine the MTS response and recovery to these events, we are provided with the opportunity to garner recommendations for more resilient MTS infrastructure through the consideration of interagency cooperation and best practices.
                <br><br>
                Please join the U.S. Committee on the Marine Transportation System (CMTS) during National Infrastructure Week 2018 for a discussion on port infrastructure resilience and lessons learned from the dramatic 2017 hurricane season. This discussion provides the opportunity to learn from Federal MTS agencies and stakeholders, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Department of Homeland Security Office of Infrastructure Protection, and the American Association of Port Authorities.

Through events, advocacy, webinars, and social media taking place around the country, participants will bring attention to infrastructure. Infrastructure Week is the largest, most diverse, non-partisan coalition of organizations dedicated to strengthening America by rebuilding our infrastructure. See how you can be involved at http://infrastructureweek.org.
